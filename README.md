Project - IBM Applied Data Science Capstone

Introduction:

This is the final project in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. You will practice the work that data scientists do in real life when working with datasets in this capstone project.  

In this project, you will assume the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, and in the process follow the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting your results to stakeholders.  

You will be tasked with predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. With the help of your Data Science findings and models, the competing startup you have been hired by can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.  

In this project, you will focus on hands-on work to demonstrate your skills in data science.
